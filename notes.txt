Express Best Practices.
* Use a directory structure in both an Express.js application and an API that includes node_modules/ config/, models/, and routes/ folders
* Best practiices when developing RESTfuil APIs include:
    - Use a noun as a resource identifier
    - Use HTTP status codes correctly
    - Black-box test REST APIs using SuperTest. Black box testing, a form of testing that is performed with no knowledge of a system's internals, can be carried out to evaluate the functionality, security, performance, and other aspects of an application. Dynamic code analysis is an example of automated black box security testing.
    - Use JWT-based stateless authentication
    - Include good documentation ( for APIs especially)
* Other tips include:
    - Following capitalization conventions
    - Use config files for variables and group similar functioning routes into their own files
